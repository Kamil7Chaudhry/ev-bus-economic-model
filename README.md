# EV-Economic-Model
Excel model focused on cost comparison for University of Delaware’s shuttle fleet: electric vs diesel. Shows total cost per mile, payback time, and long-term cost difference under different what-if scenarios (lease vs buy, energy prices, incentives). Simple inputs, clear outputs for quick decisions. For non-experts; change inputs to see results.

## Project Overview

This Excel model does one thing well: **compare costs** of electric vs. diesel shuttle buses so you can make a fast, defensible decision. Built around the University of Delaware use case, but fully editable for any fleet.

**What it does**
- Calculates total cost per mile, annual cash flows, and long-run TCO
- Shows **payback** and **NPV** under different “what-ifs” (lease vs. buy, energy prices, incentives, utilization)
- Highlights the **cost gap** between EV and diesel over time

**Who it’s for**
- Decision makers who want a clear answer without learning a new tool
- Students/analysts who need a transparent, editable model

**Use it in 60 seconds**
1. Open `EV Bus Economic Models (2).xlsx`
2. Change the input cells (fleet size, miles, prices, incentives)
3. Read the **Outputs** sheet for cost per mile, payback, and NPV

**Key outputs**
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
- Cost per mile (EV vs. diesel)
- Payback period and NPV
- Sensitivity charts (price and policy swings)

**What it isn’t**
- Not a forecasting oracle; results follow your inputs (garbage in ⇒ garbage out)
- No hidden vendor data or NDAs; numbers are example-friendly
